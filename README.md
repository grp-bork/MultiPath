MultiPath
=========

`UC-Multi` (UseCase Multi-omics) is a multi-omics [workflow](https://github.com/mdsufz/MULTI) originally developed at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research GmbH (UFZ) as a use-case for  [NFDI4Microbiota](https://nfdi4microbiota.de/). `MultiPath` is a nextflow-port developed at EMBL Heidelberg, powered by the independent [nevermore](https://github.com/cschu/nevermore) workflow component library.
